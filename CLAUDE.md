# CLAUDE.md

## Rules

- ALWAYS ask user before running `i:release` task
- **Docs ship with the change.** Any change to plugin behavior must reconcile
  `readme.md`, this file, and `docs/` in the same commit — stale docs are more
  harmful than no docs

## What This Repo Is

A Claude Code plugin marketplace (`virajp-plugins`) containing LSP servers, an
MCP server, and `vwf` — a full Product → Blueprint → Plan → Execute workflow
plugin (with post-deploy verify + production-feedback intake). The root
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` defines the marketplace; each plugin lives in
`plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

The repo also ships a **statusline**, installed via a small `oclif` CLI
(`@askviraj/ai-plugins`) rather than the marketplace — see The installer &
statusline CLI.

Plugins are pure JSON/markdown configuration plus shell scripts (no build step).
The one addition is the statusline CLI: a small plain-JS `oclif` package at the
repo root — also no build step.

The plugins have two test tasks, run **locally via pre-commit** (never in
`release.yml`, which is the installer's):

- **`plugins:check`** — static validation of **every** local plugin under
  `plugins/*`: manifest JSON validity, `plugin.json` `name`↔dir, registration in
  `marketplace.json` with the right `./plugins/<name>` source (both directions),
  `plugin.json`↔marketplace dependency sync, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` asset-ref
  resolution, agent `name:`↔filename (for plugins with an `agents/` dir), skill
  frontmatter (`name:`↔dir + `description:` + plausible `model:` when pinned),
  cross-plugin skill-name uniqueness (OpenCode installs skills into one flat
  namespace), `hooks.json` validity + script existence/executability, relative
  links under `assets/examples/**`, and the installer sync assertion
  (`bin/claude.mjs` `PLUGINS` ≡ marketplace names, `PROJECT_SCOPED`/`OPT_IN` ⊆
  `PLUGINS`, `PLUGIN_DEPS` ≡ the marketplace dependency lists). url-sourced
  entries (e.g. `mempalace`) are covered only for JSON validity. Scoped to fire
  when anything under `plugins/` or the marketplace manifest changes.
- **`vwf:test`** — table-tests the `vwf` `npm-to-pnpm.sh` hook through the
  system sed (the BSD-sed portability guarantee); vwf-specific since it is the
  only plugin shipping a hook. Scoped to `plugins/vwf/hooks/`.

Plugin/skill version numbers are **not** cross-checked — they are independent by
design (a plugin may hold skills versioned on their own cadence).

## Plugin Structure

Every plugin is a directory under `plugins/` with a
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Minimal form:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://www.schemastore.org/claude-code-plugin-manifest.json",
  "name": "<plugin-name>"
}
```

Plugins may declare any combination of:

- **`lspServers`** — LSP server definitions keyed by language ID. Each entry
  needs `command`, `args`, `extensionToLanguage`, and optionally
  `startupTimeout`. `plugins/flutter` bundles three — `dart-lsp` (run via
  `mise`) plus `kotlin-lsp` and `sourcekit-lsp` (Swift), which invoke
  system-installed binaries on `PATH`.
- **`mcpServers`** — MCP server definitions. See
  `plugins/context7/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- **`dependencies`** — other plugins this plugin requires (see below); `vwf` is
  the only one that declares them, all resolved within `virajp-plugins` itself.
  `plugins:check` enforces that the `plugin.json` and marketplace-entry
  dependency lists are **identical**. A dependency *may* point at **another
  marketplace** (each entry carries its own `marketplace`), but
  cross-marketplace deps are **blocked at install time** unless the ROOT
  `marketplace.json` allowlists that foreign marketplace via top-level
  `allowCrossMarketplaceDependenciesOn` (not transitive — only the installing
  marketplace's allowlist applies). No plugin here currently uses one, so that
  allowlist is absent; re-add it if a cross-marketplace dependency is
  introduced.

Skills, agents, and hooks are **auto-discovered by directory convention** — they
do not need to be listed in `plugin.json`:

- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` → skills, invocable as `/<plugin>:<name>` (Claude
  Code's unified skills — a skill with `disable-model-invocation: true` is
  user-only, i.e. exactly a classic slash command). This repo has **no
  `commands/` dirs**: former commands are skills, so one artifact serves both
  Claude Code and OpenCode.
- `agents/<name>.md` → subagents
- `hooks/hooks.json` → hooks (see Hooks below)

The marketplace manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists each plugin
with its `source`, `version`, `category`, `tags`, and optional `dependencies`.

## The vwf Plugin

`vwf` is the flagship plugin. Its layout under `plugins/vwf/`:

- `skills/` (workflow) — the `/vwf:` slash-invocable workflow skills (each
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; model-invocable too since
  `disable-model-invocation: false`): the Product → Blueprint → Plan → Execute
  model — `setup` (Phase-0 onboarding/migration bootstrapper; ends by offering
  `/vwf:blueprint`), `product` (the Phase −1 outcome contract:
  problem/users/goals with `#goal-<slug>` anchors/slice priority; `blueprint`
  halts without it), `architecture`, `design-system` (the UX/visual contract;
  **Claude Design is the preferred authoring surface and `import` the
  recommended default** — Claude Design ships strong design systems; pick or
  iterate one on the canvas and `import` distills it into the repo doc as data
  through the normal reviewer gate; `generate` (demoted — bespoke brand
  constraints) elicits an intent-level brief, writes it to
  `docs/prompts/NNN-design-system.md`, and seeds the pinned canvas project's
  chat via `put_conversation` (a readable copy the user pastes into the
  composer); text elicitation stays the no-canvas fallback; the doc is the
  contract of record, doc-side edits offer a publish back to the canvas, and
  two-sided drift is resolved by an explicit direction choice, never a silent
  merge; a `cli` platform additionally requires the text-elicited **Terminal
  UX** section; pins `design.design_system_id`), `blueprint` (a **full-product,
  flow-first sweep** — a run works a coverage worklist flow by flow, deriving
  the entities/schemas/API operations each flow stands on; a flow pass with
  Screens **gates on an in-pass render & review** (§6a: per-flow
  `mockup-generator` + canvas push per the canvas-push asset — the user sees the
  screens, happy and sad paths, before approving the pass; a local render
  satisfies the gate offline; the user may instead defer **design-first** to
  `/vwf:screens` (brief out, canvas designs, import folds back); an explicit
  skip records `screens/<flow>` in `blueprint.remaining`) — until whole-product
  coverage holds **and the whole-product coherence review passes**, then stamps
  `blueprint.coverage` in `.config/vwf.yaml` and offers `/vwf:plan`), `mockups`
  (the **batch re-render / regeneration tool** — blueprint passes render screens
  in-pass, so this sweeps or refreshes: after a design-system change, for a
  legacy repo, or one flow post-hoc; per-flow `mockup-generator` subagents into
  an ephemeral build dir, never committed, pushed per the canvas-push asset
  behind an explicit approval gate; pins one design project per registry UI
  project (`design.projects.<project>` — shared or separate canvases, the
  product's call) and records `design.flows_pushed` in `.config/vwf.yaml`; never
  a gate for `plan`), `screens` (the **two-way screen sync**: `prompt <flow>`
  writes a numbered design brief to `docs/prompts/` under the naming contract
  `<flow>/<screen-slug>` — the flow folder name is the join key, machine- and
  human-reconcilable — and delivers it to the flow's canvas chat; `import`
  matches the designed pages back by that name (unmatched pages get a per-page
  MCQ), asks **one MCQ per delta** (accept/reject/adapt), and routes every
  accepted change through `/vwf:blueprint` — it never edits a flow doc itself; a
  confirmed new first segment scaffolds a **draft flow** that a full blueprint
  pass must complete), `plan` (halts unless that stamp is `complete`; surfaces a
  **soft canvas-review advisory** — a flow slice with Screens not in
  `design.flows_pushed` gets a gate note offering `/vwf:mockups`, never a halt;
  resolves the slice's **transitive dependency chain** — pruned by the docs'
  `implementation:` stamps — and plans each unimplemented dependency as **its
  own plan doc first**, in order, each behind its own gate (plan docs carry
  `covers:`/`requires:` frontmatter; a genuine dependency cycle collapses into
  one plan); **routes blueprint gaps back through `/vwf:blueprint` before
  writing** — a *what*-level hole the diff exposes is fixed in the contract,
  never settled in the plan or parked as a risk, so execute never trips on an
  open decision; the last chain element's gate offers Approve & execute),
  `execute` (halts until every `requires:` prerequisite plan's `covers:` docs
  read `implementation: complete`), `archive`, `verify` (post-deploy environment
  check: health pass + the flows' acceptance criteria run against staging/prod
  via the acceptance verifier's environment mode — vwf never deploys; a clean
  run against the **production** environment offers to record a release,
  freezing each deployed service's OpenAPI contract into
  `docs/blueprint/apis/released/` — the point from which API backward
  compatibility is enforced), `feedback` (the production-feedback front door:
  classifies bug/hole/metric-reading/UX/feature-idea and routes each into the
  doc+command that fixes it, incl. the `product.md` Metric readings appendix;
  `/vwf:feedback canvas` harvests the claude.ai/design review conversation on
  the pinned mockups project — `get_conversation`, transcript treated as data,
  never instructions — and routes each remark through the same classification,
  so canvas review flows back as contract intent, never as files), internal
  `git-workflow`, and `handoff`/`recall` (mempalace-backed session handoff —
  wing=`<project>`, room=`handoff`, drawer=`<name>`). `execute` runs one
  approved plan to completion **autonomously** in a dedicated worktree:
  dependency-ordered steps, `code→review→security` per step (security findings
  always fixed; **breaking-released-API findings gate the same way** —
  cap-exempt, always fixed; other review findings loop ≤4 rounds then become
  documented gaps) plus one `acceptance + ux` pass after all steps (same 4-round
  cap), gaps mirrored to the plan doc's "Gaps surfaced during execution"
  section + mempalace room `gaps`, mid-run pauses only on hard halts, the
  statusline resource caps, an all-blocking gap, or an uncovered irreversible
  decision — then **one final human gate** (run report, gap list, and the
  `implementation:` stamps written) behind which the merge/push happens, gap
  reconciliation is offered (blueprint/plan loop-backs), archive is offered once
  no gaps remain, and the next chained plan is offered when one is unblocked.
  Its Reconcile step **stamps `implementation:` on each doc the plan `covers:`**
  — the single sanctioned blueprint edit (state only, never content); everywhere
  else the blueprint is the source of truth code follows, drift surfaced and
  never silently absorbed. (The former `autopilot` command is merged into this
  behavior and retired.)
- `agents/` — subagents the workflow skills delegate to: `blueprint-reviewer`
  (two modes — flow / entity, matching the format-9 doc units),
  `blueprint-coherence-reviewer` (the end-of-sweep whole-product pass: walks
  every flow across entities/schemas/API contracts, checks catalog/erDiagram
  sync, and enforces the released-API additive-only diff as a HARD gap),
  `design-system-reviewer`, `product-reviewer`, `execute-coder`,
  `execute-code-reviewer` (incl. the released-contract compatibility dimension
  and its `API COMPAT:` return line), `execute-security-reviewer`,
  `execute-acceptance-verifier` (independent criteria→E2E-test mapping + run;
  also `/vwf:verify`'s environment mode), `execute-ux-reviewer` (renders changed
  screens via dev server + Playwright screenshots, judges against
  design-system + the flow Screens contract, axe a11y scan; code-level-only for
  Flutter), `architecture-writer`, `mockup-generator` (per-flow: Screens
  contract + design-system tokens → self-contained HTML mockups in a scratch
  build dir, returns only a manifest)
- `skills/` (doctrine, auto-applying) — `rest-api-design`; `product-foundations`
  (the nine foundational concerns every product decides — users & operators,
  observability (OTel→Grafana), audit logs (privileged+destructive baseline),
  change logs (Keep-a-Changelog→fastlane), background processes (sync/async +
  worker-vs-service placement, ask only on ambiguity), data retention & PII,
  notifications, runtime settings, rate limiting — **elicited defaults**
  distilled from 95octane: `/vwf:architecture` walks the checklist in step 3c
  (accept/adapt/skip → `cross_cutting` tokens), `/vwf:blueprint` expands
  accepted ones into `conventions.md` anchors + per-flow surfaces (audit markers
  on Trigger & Actors/steps, sync/async placement on the flow's Jobs table),
  execute's docs-sync drafts app changelog entries; realizations live in
  `assets/stacks/`); `blueprint-authoring` (the contract-vs-realization
  doctrine + per-surface completeness bars — the **flow-contract** bar (steps,
  Acceptance block **and sequence diagram**, the screen home rule), the slimmed
  **entity-contract** bar (lifecycle state-diagram, `Used by:` flow edge), and
  **api-and-schema-contracts** (the `schema.yaml` / OpenAPI bars, YAML
  path-typing, the released-snapshot additive-only rule) — + the doc-unit
  doctrine, auto-applies on `docs/blueprint/**` and — for frontmatter/link
  hygiene only — `docs/plans/**`); `design-system-authoring` (the
  UX/visual-contract doctrine — tokens, typography, spacing, motion,
  accessibility, components/anti-patterns, terminal-ux (CLI/TUI conventions,
  required when a project declares platform `cli`) — auto-applies on
  `docs/blueprint/design-system`); `project-setup` (onboarding/migration
  doctrine — topology detection incl. the **enforced** workspace shape (parent
  repo + backend/frontend submodules: applied for new/empty repos, proposed as a
  consent-gated restructure for non-conforming existing ones) and the **enforced
  reference stacks** (fixed per project type, one stack doc each under
  `assets/stacks/`; explicit opt-outs recorded under `enforcement:` in
  `.config/vwf.yaml`, never re-asked), harness-capability detection (per the
  harness contract, stamped in `.config/vwf.yaml`), consent-gated dry-run
  migration, the blueprint format-version + drift map; used by `/vwf:setup`)
- `assets/templates/` — `flow` (Purpose carries the `Serves:` goal-link line;
  Trigger & Actors, Steps, sequence diagram, Screens, Jobs, Acceptance),
  `flows-index` (flow catalog + inter-service contracts), `entity` (the slimmed
  data contract; Purpose carries a `Used by:` flow-link line), `entities-index`
  (entity catalog + product-wide erDiagram), `schema.yaml` (the JSON-Schema
  data-model skeleton), `openapi.yaml` (the OpenAPI 3.1 contract skeleton incl.
  `info.x-vwf`), `conventions`, `plan` (incl. the `covers:`/`requires:`
  frontmatter and the "Acceptance criteria (from blueprint)" section `plan`
  fills and the acceptance stage verifies), `product`, `architecture`,
  `design-system`, `environment` (the per-project env-var/secret catalog),
  `screen-prompt` (the `/vwf:screens prompt` design brief — carries the
  verbatim-mandatory naming contract; no OKF frontmatter, it is a canvas brief,
  not a blueprint doc), `project-claude` (the vwf section `/vwf:setup` merges
  into a repo's CLAUDE.md), `handoff` (stack-agnostic; section→project mapping
  resolved from the registry). All blueprint markdown templates open with the
  OKF frontmatter block; flow/entity templates carry `implementation: none`
- `assets/examples/blueprint/` — a **format-9 conformance bundle**
  (`flows/place-order/` + `flows/cancel-refund/` + `flows/index.md`,
  `entities/order/` + `entities/customer/` (`index.md` + `schema.yaml` each) +
  `entities/index.md`, `apis/api.openapi.yaml`, plus `product.md`,
  `conventions.md`, `design-system.md`, `environment.md`): a worked,
  format-valid slice where every relationship/reference/goal link resolves, each
  flow carries a worked Acceptance block + sequence diagram, the order lifecycle
  its state diagram, and the entity catalog its erDiagram. Referenced from the
  blueprint-authoring skill as the concrete "what good looks like"; its
  asset-refs and relative links (`.md` and `.yaml`) are covered by
  `plugins:check`
- `assets/elicitation.md` — the shared questioning protocol referenced by
  `product`, `blueprint`, `plan`, `architecture`, `design-system`, `setup`, and
  `feedback`; incl. the **parked-scope rule** — an answer that goes beyond the
  current pass's scope is filed to mempalace room `gaps` (tag `<slice>/parked`)
  and mirrored into the pass's doc (Open Questions / Out of scope / Risks)
  before the next question, so a scope change arriving in a new session recalls
  it
- `assets/execute-stages.md` — the stage pipeline used by `execute`: the
  code→review→security→acceptance+ux table (acceptance + ux run once per cycle
  after all steps; each conditional and skipped explicitly, stated at the final
  gate), per-stage subagent contracts (incl. the slice/round tags, the
  coverage-report policy, and the acceptance/ux `n/a` gap policy), shared stage
  rules (model enforcement, terse output, loop-on-findings with the recall-miss
  fallback, gap capture, the blueprint-is-source-of-truth drift rule with its
  single `implementation:`-stamp carve-out), and the end-of-run reconcile
  (architecture/environment/harness/docs + the implementation stamps)
- `assets/capability-vocabulary.md` — the stack-agnostic capability tokens
  shared by `/vwf:architecture` elicitation and the `architecture-writer`
- `assets/canvas-push.md` — the **shared claude.ai/design push protocol**
  (surface resolution DesignSync → claude-design MCP → local-only, pin-first
  project resolution, `get_claude_design_prompt` → `finalize_plan` →
  `write_files`, `render_preview` sample verify, the serve_url-never-surfaces
  rule) used by `blueprint` §6a, `mockups`, and `design-system`
- `assets/vwf-config.md` — the **vwf config** doctrine for `.config/vwf.yaml`
  (one per workspace, config_format 5): the stamp keys, `product`/`memory.wing`,
  the **`blueprint:` coverage stamp** (written by every blueprint sweep; `plan`
  halts unless `coverage: complete`; `remaining:` names `flows/<flow>` /
  `screens/<flow>` (a skipped §6a visual review) / `entities/<entity>` /
  `apis/<project>` / `coherence`), per-project nuances (`platforms:` extensions,
  coverage/health overrides), the `harness:` inventory, the **`enforcement:`
  block** (structure/stack/rule opt-outs — moved out of the registry, which now
  purely describes the system), bounded `pipeline` knobs (coverage target,
  review round cap, stage model tiers — downgrades always reported at the gate —
  and tighten-only `execute_caps` honored by the statusline caps hook, which
  also reads the legacy `autopilot_caps` name; the `1 → 2` config migration is
  the rename), `verify` `environments` + the optional **`production_env`** key
  (names the release environment; default = the env literally named
  `production`; the `2 → 3` migration is a bump + these semantics — the release
  record itself is the `apis/released/` snapshot dir, never config), the
  **`design:` block** (claude.ai/design pins — the **universal**
  `design_system_id` (one per product, its own canvas project) and the
  **per-registry-project** `projects:` map (each UI project's mockup canvas —
  shared or separate uuids) — plus the `flows_pushed` canvas-currency list
  `blueprint`'s render step and `mockups` record, `blueprint` drops on an
  unrendered Screens change, and `plan`'s soft advisory reads; the `3 → 4`
  migration renames `mockups:` → `design:`, the `4 → 5` migration splits
  `project_id` into the `projects:` map, readers honoring legacy keys as drift),
  and `docs_sync` scope. Hard floor: config can never disable security review,
  TDD, the approval gates, the reviewer bars, or the **released-API
  compatibility gate**. Readers fall back to the legacy
  `docs/blueprint/.vwf.yml` (its presence = pre-6 drift)
- `assets/harness.md` — the **harness contract**: the verification capabilities
  a repo must be able to run (`dev`, `e2e_local`, `local_stack`, `e2e_staging`,
  `health`, `screenshots`) with canonical task-name conventions. `setup` detects
  and stamps them (the config's `harness:` block — vwf-internal, never a format
  bump), `plan`'s harness preflight re-verifies what a slice's gates need and
  injects bootstrap steps for missing ones (guardrails — exempt from
  minimalism), execute's reconcile updates the stamp, and the
  acceptance/ux/verify surfaces name any `n/a` in this vocabulary — so harness
  gaps surface at plan time with the fix attached, not at the gate
- `assets/stacks/` — the **enforced reference stack** docs, one per project type
  (`packages`, `service`, `worker`, `site`, `console`, `frontend`) plus
  `monorepo.md` (backend monorepo tooling), distilled from the 95octane
  reference implementation. Read by `/vwf:setup` (onboarding) and
  `/vwf:architecture` (registry `stack` — stated, not elicited; an override
  becomes a config `enforcement:` entry). The common-package placement rules
  (`rules/schemas-in-common`, `rules/integrations-via-common`) are seeded into
  each repo's `conventions.md#patterns` and enforced by the execute reviewers
- `assets/memory.md` — the shared mempalace memory protocol (recall before work,
  persist durable decisions, findings memory for loop-backs, and **gap memory**:
  blueprint/plan holes surfaced during execution + out-of-scope points parked
  during elicitation, room `gaps`) referenced by `product`, `blueprint`, `plan`,
  `execute`, `verify`, and `feedback`. The orchestrator resolves the project
  wing and persists decisions; the execute subagents (coder, reviewers,
  acceptance/ux verifiers) file and recall findings **directly** — they are
  granted scoped mempalace MCP tools in their agent frontmatter
  (`mcp__plugin_mempalace_mempalace__mempalace_search` / `…_add_drawer`), so
  rich review detail lives in mempalace instead of the orchestrator's context.
  Gaps are also mirrored to a durable "Gaps surfaced during execution" section
  in the plan doc, so they survive a mempalace outage and feed the
  blueprint/plan fixes. The skip-silently-when-down rule carves out
  `handoff`/`recall`, which fall back to `docs/handoffs/<name>.md` instead
- `assets/graphify.md` — the **code-intelligence protocol**: when a repo carries
  a knowledge graph (`graphify-out/graph.json`), codebase-understanding
  questions go graph-first (`graphify query`/`path`/`explain`) with file reads
  as verification (the graph orients, the file is the evidence; the graph
  reflects the last commit, so the uncommitted diff is always read directly, and
  execute's worktrees reach back to the main checkout's graph). Wired into
  `plan`'s actual-state survey, `setup`'s topology detection, `architecture`'s
  update-mode delta detection, `feedback`'s surface location, docs-sync's
  contradicted-doc search, and the execute coder (reuse discovery) /
  code-reviewer (impact) / security-reviewer (call-path threat model) /
  acceptance-verifier (test-mapping seed). Absence never blocks — every surface
  falls back to direct reads silently; only `/vwf:setup` builds a graph
  (consent-gated, end of onboarding, plus the post-commit refresh hook)
- `assets/docs-sync.md` — the **docs-sync rule** (stale docs are more harmful
  than no docs): every run that changes reality — `execute` (landed code, via
  the shared Reconcile step 4), `architecture` and `product` in update mode —
  ends by reconciling the repo's human docs (README, CLAUDE.md, anything the
  change contradicts) in the same worktree/commit flow, reporting what was
  synced or `docs: nothing contradicted`. `blueprint`/`plan` are exempt (their
  output documents intent, not reality); `setup` owns full authoring
- `assets/format-check.md` + `assets/blueprint-format` — the **format-drift
  preflight**: `product`, `blueprint`, `plan`, `execute`, `design-system`, and
  `verify` compare a repo's `.config/vwf.yaml` stamp (legacy fallback:
  `docs/blueprint/.vwf.yml`) to the format integer vwf ships
  (`blueprint-format`) and nudge `/vwf:setup` when behind (halting only if a
  needed artifact is missing). Since vwf is user-scoped — upgraded once
  globally, with no per-repo install event — this usage-time check is what
  reaches each repo, self-healing on next use
- `hooks/` — `hooks.json` + `npm-to-pnpm.sh`

Docs the commands maintain live under `docs/blueprint/` (the outcome contract
`product.md` — problem/users/goals/slice-priority + the `/vwf:feedback`-owned
Metric readings appendix — registry `architecture.md`, `conventions.md`, the
product-wide `design-system.md`, the per-project env-var/secret catalog
`environment.md`; **one flow folder per flow** — `flows/<flow>/index.md`, each
carrying its Screens, Jobs, and Acceptance block — with `flows/index.md` the
catalog + inter-service contracts; **one entity folder per entity** —
`entities/<entity>/` holding exactly `index.md` + `schema.yaml` — with
`entities/index.md` the catalog + product-wide erDiagram; and the API contracts
`apis/<project>.openapi.yaml` + the frozen `apis/released/` snapshots; the
blueprint root holds only the system docs), `docs/plans/`
(`<date>-<time>-<slice>.md`, with `archived/`), and `docs/prompts/` (`NNN-*.md`
— numbered canvas design briefs written by `/vwf:screens prompt` and
`/vwf:design-system generate`; committed intent artifacts, not blueprint docs).
Superseded commands/agents/templates are archived under `archived/vwf-<date>/`
(`vwf-2026-06-19/` from the prior model; `vwf-2026-07-04/` holds the retired
`autopilot` command, whose behavior merged into `execute`; `vwf-2026-07-07/` the
format-8 `integration.md` template, dissolved into the flow templates).

The `docs/blueprint/` tree is an **OKF bundle** — vwf is an opinionated
*profile* of Google's Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.1. Since **blueprint-format
2**, every doc is a typed OKF concept: it opens with mandatory YAML frontmatter
(`type` from a fixed vocabulary —
`vwf-product`/`vwf-architecture`/`vwf-conventions`/`vwf-design-system`/
`vwf-environment`/`vwf-integration`/`vwf-flow`/`vwf-entities`/`vwf-entity`/
`vwf-plan`/`vwf-gap-report` — plus `title`, `description`, `status`; optional
`timestamp`/`owner`/`resource`/`tags`; flow/entity docs additionally carry the
pipeline-owned `implementation:` build stamp), and cross-doc relationships are
typed markdown links (the OKF edge) rather than prose. YAML artifacts
(`schema.yaml`, `*.openapi.yaml`) are typed by **path**, not frontmatter (the
OpenAPI files carry only `info.x-vwf.status`). This makes a blueprint portable
to any OKF-aware tool (e.g. the OKF static-HTML visualizer) and ingestable by
graphify, and lets the `blueprint-reviewer` verify frontmatter + that every edge
resolves. The doctrine lives in the blueprint-authoring skill's
`frontmatter-and-links` reference; the format is carried by `blueprint-format` +
the `N → N+1` deltas in the project-setup skill's `format-versioning` reference,
so `/vwf:setup` migrates stale repos on next use. **Format 3** added the
`vwf-environment` type and the `environment.md` catalog; **format 4** the
Acceptance block on every flow (what the execute acceptance stage verifies);
**format 5** the `vwf-product` type + `product.md` foundation and the goal links
(see Foundations below); **format 7** mermaid diagrams as contract views — the
`architecture.md` system-shape flowchart (in sync with the registry), a
`sequenceDiagram` per flow (incl. the failure branch), and a `stateDiagram-v2`
per entity lifecycle with ≥3 states or branching — always views of the
authoritative tables/steps, never additions to them (format 6 is the
`.config/vwf.yaml` move, described under `assets/vwf-config.md`); **format 8**
folders-only entities; **format 9** the **process-based restructure** — flows
become the primary unit (`flows/<flow>/index.md`, absorbing Screens/Jobs and the
old `integration.md`, which dissolves into `flows/index.md`), entities slim to
data contracts under `entities/<entity>/` (`index.md` + `schema.yaml`), API
contracts move to `apis/<project>.openapi.yaml` with frozen production snapshots
under `apis/released/`, the product-wide `erDiagram` lands in
`entities/index.md`, and the `implementation:` stamp arrives — migrated by
`setup` in two phases (mechanical `git mv` scaffold + an elicited
`/vwf:blueprint` fill; coverage stays `partial` between them).

**Foundations & ordering.** The workflow is
`setup → product → architecture → design-system → blueprint → plan → execute`,
with `verify` (post-deploy) and `feedback` (production intake) closing the loop
back into `product`/`blueprint`/`plan`. `setup` is the Phase-0 bootstrapper — it
onboards a repo (detect-or-ask topology via MCQ, consent-gated migration into
the `docs/blueprint/` format, orchestrates
mise/product/architecture/design-system, authors CLAUDE.md + README) and is
**re-runnable**: it stamps the blueprint format version in `.config/vwf.yaml`
and, on a later run, detects drift against the format the installed vwf ships
and migrates the delta. `product.md` (the Phase −1 outcome contract, type
`vwf-product`, gated by the `product-reviewer`) and `architecture` (the
registry) are both unconditionally required before `blueprint` — every
**flow's** Purpose must `Serves:`-link a product goal anchor (entities trace to
goals transitively via their `Used by:` flow links), which the
`blueprint-reviewer` verifies and the minimalism check traces to.
`design-system` is a second foundation, **required once the registry has a UI
project** (type `site`, `frontend`, or `console`): `blueprint` halts on a flow
with a Screens surface if `docs/blueprint/design-system.md` is missing.
`environment.md` (the per-project env-var/secret catalog, type
`vwf-environment`) is a third foundation, **required once the registry declares
an external integration or a secrets-manager `config`** — `setup` bootstraps it
from the repo's existing env-var/secret usage (names only, never values) and
`blueprint` maintains it as flows add integrations, with `conventions.md#config`
holding only the injection mechanism. **Everything up to `blueprint` is done in
full before planning**: a blueprint run sweeps until whole-product coverage
holds (every goal served by a flow, every referenced entity/schema/API operation
authored + reviewed, every registry surface represented, the coherence review
clean) and stamps it; `plan` hard-halts on a partial stamp and chains its
slice's unimplemented dependencies as their own plans, so per-slice execution
never builds on an unblueprinted or unbuilt dependency. The blueprint is a
**code-independent technical contract** — it records only decisions that have
more than one reasonable answer *and* are true regardless of how the code is
written today; reuse/placement/ordering/library choices are `plan`'s job. The
`blueprint-reviewer` gate enforces the per-doc completeness bars (flow steps,
acceptance, screens, jobs; entity lifecycle, relationships, concurrency, schema;
API errors + idempotency), the goal-traceability bars (`Serves:` on flows,
`Used by:` on entities), and the code-independence guardrail (no
file/class/library/CSS/pixel leakage); the `blueprint-coherence-reviewer` closes
the sweep with the cross-doc pass (flow↔lifecycle↔schema↔operationId agreement,
catalog/erDiagram sync, the released-API additive-only diff).

### Dependencies

`vwf` depends on `claude-design`, `context7`, `markdown`, `mempalace`, and
`mise` — **all resolved from the `virajp-plugins` marketplace itself**, so
installing `vwf` needs no other marketplace registered. `claude-design`,
`context7`, `markdown`, and `mise` are authored here; `mempalace` is not — it is
**re-listed** in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` via a `url` source (pointing
at its upstream repo) so it lives under `virajp-plugins`.

The dependency list is declared in **two** places, which must stay in sync —
both reference `@virajp-plugins` for every entry (the `plugins:check` task
enforces this):

- `plugins/vwf/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `claude-design`, `context7`,
  `markdown`, `mempalace`, `mise`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (vwf entry) → `claude-design`, `context7`,
  `markdown`, `mempalace`, `mise`

When `vwf` is enabled, Claude Code (≥ 2.1.143) **auto-installs and
auto-enables** these dependencies at the same scope. Key rules:

- **Keep both dependency lists in sync.** A new dep must be added to both
  `plugin.json` and the vwf entry in `marketplace.json`, and (if external)
  re-listed as its own `url`-sourced plugin in `marketplace.json` so it resolves
  within `virajp-plugins`.
- **Auto-enable is event-driven**, firing only when the parent (`vwf`) is
  enabled — not on a continuous reconcile. If a dependency is later disabled on
  its own, re-enable it directly or toggle `vwf` off/on.

## The installer & statusline CLI

The statusline is **not** a Claude Code plugin — it is an `oclif` CLI published
as `@askviraj/ai-plugins` that installs the toolkit for **Claude Code and/or
OpenCode** (plugins, OpenCode-rendered skills, and the powerline statusline).
Layout:

- `tools/statusline/statusline` — the executable Node script (node shebang).
  Drives **both** surfaces from one file: a stdin payload with a `tasks` array
  renders the subagent panel, anything else the main two-line bar.
- `tools/statusline/statusline.json` — the bundled default config (every
  constant: palette, powerline glyphs, symbols, per-segment styling, line
  layout, subagent panel). The installer seeds this into
  `~/.config/statusline.json`.
- `package.json` (root) — the npm package: oclif single-command CLI, `bin`
  `ai-plugins`, sole runtime dep `@oclif/core`. Plain JS (ESM) — no build step.
  The package `type` stays `commonjs`: the `bin/` modules are ESM by their
  `.mjs` extension, while the standalone `tools/statusline/` scripts (run
  outside this package, with no package.json beside them) must remain CommonJS —
  so the ESM/CJS split is carried per-file, not by a package-wide
  `type: module`.
- `bin/installer.mjs` — the CLI entrypoint: the oclif command class plus the
  bootstrap that runs it (single-command `strategy`/`target` in `package.json`;
  `settings.enableAutoTranspile = false` keeps oclif from hunting for
  TypeScript). It dispatches to one **tool module per platform** —
  `bin/claude.mjs` (the `ClaudeCode` tool) and `bin/opencode.mjs` (the
  `OpenCode` tool), both exposing the same surface
  (`resolvePlan`/`hasSelection`/`install`/`upgrade`/`uninstall`/`printVersions`)
  — plus `bin/utils.mjs` (shared helpers). `--platform claude|opencode`
  (repeatable) selects targets; omitted, every platform whose binary is on
  `PATH` is targeted. The run-directly guard uses
  `realpathSync(process.argv[1]) === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` (the ESM
  equivalent of `require.main === module`, symlink-safe for the npm bin).
- `bin/opencode.mjs` — the OpenCode target. OpenCode has no plugin/marketplace
  concept, so install = **render**: fetch the repo source (GitHub `main`
  tarball; `AI_PLUGINS_SOURCE_DIR` — a local checkout — overrides for
  tests/dev), copy each selected plugin's `skills/` + `assets/` into
  `<configDir>/virajp-plugins/<plugin>/` (`--user` → `~/.config/opencode/`,
  `--project` → `.opencode/`; agents/hooks are Claude-only, skipped), rewrite
  every `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to the installed absolute path, stamp `.version`
  from the source marketplace manifest, **segregate workflow skills** (each
  `disable-model-invocation` skill moves to `commands/<name>/index.md`, outside
  the `**/SKILL.md` discovery — the model never auto-invokes them, mirroring
  Claude's user-only semantics; doctrine skills stay under `skills/`), append
  the `virajp-plugins` dir to `skills.paths` in the OpenCode config (targeted
  array append; foreign keys preserved), map the plugin's `lspServers` onto the
  config's `lsp` key (`LSP_ID_MAP` — overrides of OpenCode's built-in ids with
  the plugins' mise-provisioned launchers, stamped per plugin as `.lsp.json` so
  uninstall removes exactly what was written and never a user-modified entry),
  write a **command wrapper** `command/<plugin>-<skill>.md` per
  `disable-model-invocation` skill (OpenCode has no user-invoked skills), and
  write each plugin's MCP server (`MCP_ENTRIES`: context7 via `pnpm dlx`,
  mempalace via `mise x -- mempalace-mcp`, claude-design as a `remote` entry
  pointing at Anthropic's endpoint) to the config's `mcp` key. **Upstream
  plugins** (`UPSTREAM`): mempalace installs from its own repo (tarball;
  `AI_PLUGINS_UPSTREAM_DIR` overrides for tests) — its repo root is the plugin
  root (skills/ + integrations/ copied, versioned by its plugin.json), and its
  Claude hooks are replaced by the bundled `tools/opencode/mempalace-hooks.js`,
  copied to `<configDir>/plugin/` — an OpenCode plugin that injects a MemPalace
  save-checkpoint prompt every 15 user messages (`session.idle`) and after
  compaction (`session.compacted`), honoring mempalace's auto-save opt-out.
  **Config file:** edits target an existing `opencode.jsonc` first (OpenCode
  merges all config names, jsonc wins), else an existing `opencode.json`; a new
  file is created as `opencode.jsonc`. All names are read JSONC-tolerantly, and
  a config with comments is only rewritten after confirmation (or `--yes`) since
  a rewrite drops them. **Dependencies** expand at plan time from `PLUGIN_DEPS`
  in `claude.mjs` (kept ≡ the marketplace lists by `plugins:check`; Claude Code
  auto-installs them natively) — installs only, uninstall never removes an
  unnamed dependency. **User-level-only:** `USER_ONLY` plugins (mempalace) are
  pinned to user scope — a `--project` request or project-scoped dep expansion
  redirects them (with a note). A vwf install wires **graphify at user level
  only**: the CLI is run with a throwaway cwd (its user-level skills land in
  `~/.config/opencode/skills/graphify/`), and the project-level `graphify.js` it
  generates is harvested into the GLOBAL `plugin/` dir — no project writes, no
  `plugin`-array entry (the dir is auto-discovered). url-sourced plugins
  **without** `UPSTREAM` support (andrej-karpathy-skills) are filtered from
  `--all`, rejected when named, and skipped (with a note) as dependencies.
  `--uninstall`/`--upgrade`/`--version` mirror all of this via the `.version`
  stamps.
- `tools/statusline/context-caps.js` — the context/rate-limit caps `PostToolUse`
  hook, bundled with the main `statusLine` install (see Statusline below).
- `test/` — `node --test` suites run by `i:test` (and thus in `release.yml`):
  `utils.test.mjs` (cmpVer/cmpPre/deepMerge incl. prototype-pollution keys),
  `statusline.test.mjs` (hermetic smoke tests for both render surfaces + the
  usage-file contract `context-caps.js` reads), and `opencode.test.mjs`
  (hermetic OpenCode installs into a temp `$HOME` with
  `AI_PLUGINS_SOURCE_DIR=<checkout>`: render/rewrite, wrapper emission, config
  idempotency + foreign-key preservation, uninstall symmetry). Not shipped in
  the npm package (`files` is `bin` + `tools`).

The command does several jobs. **Plugins:** `--all` (every user-scoped plugin,
at user scope) or `--user <name>` / `--project <name>` (repeatable; name plugins
at user or project scope) drive the `claude` CLI to add the `virajp-plugins`
marketplace (user scope) and install each plugin. `--all` installs **user-scoped
plugins only** (`USER_SCOPED`); **project-scoped** plugins (`flutter` —
`PROJECT_SCOPED`) and **opt-in** plugins (`andrej-karpathy-skills` — `OPT_IN`,
an external re-listed plugin) are both excluded from `--all`. Project-scoped
plugins are reached via `--project <name>`; opt-in plugins via
`--user`/`--project
<name>` at whichever scope you choose (they carry no forced
default). Scope is carried by the flag itself — `--user` installs at user scope,
`--project` at project scope, and the two compose in one run (a name cannot
appear in both). This governs install and uninstall alike, but never the
marketplace add (always user scope). Plugin names are **bare and allowlisted**
(`PLUGINS`); an `@marketplace` or path qualifier is rejected outright so the CLI
can only ever install from `virajp-plugins`. The CLI installs and refreshes
**only** `virajp-plugins`; every plugin (including the bundled Dart/Kotlin/Swift
language servers, which ship inside `flutter`) resolves from it alone — no other
marketplace is registered or refreshed. Installing or upgrading **`vwf`**
additionally runs `setupGraphify` — `graphify install --platform claude` plus
`graphify hook install` — since vwf's commands depend on graphify's knowledge
graph. `graphify install` works anywhere and always runs;
`graphify hook
install` attaches a git post-commit hook, so it runs **only
inside a git repo** (detected via `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`) and is
soft-skipped with a note otherwise. Both commands are idempotent (so an upgrade
self-heals the setup), and the whole step is soft-skipped when `graphify` isn't
on `PATH` (the `checkDeps` gate guarantees it for installs, but the upgrade-only
path does not run that gate). **Statusline:** `--statusline` — one merged flag
that installs **both** the main bar `statusLine` and the subagent panel
`subagentStatusLine` — copies the script into `~/.claude/scripts/` (chmod 755),
seeds the bundled defaults into `~/.config/statusline.json` (deep-merging
missing settings if it already exists, preserving user edits), and writes both
keys into `~/.claude/settings.json` (preserving other keys; prompting before
overwrite unless `--yes`). `--all` installs plugins only — pair it with
`--statusline` for the bar. Installing the statusline additionally wires the
**context/rate-limit caps** `PostToolUse` hook (`installContextCaps`): it copies
`tools/statusline/context-caps.js` into `~/.claude/hooks/`, sets
`env.AI_PLUGINS_USAGE_DIR` (`${HOME}/.claude/usage`), and appends the hook entry
(idempotently, preserving other env keys / PostToolUse hooks). The statusline's
`writeUsageFile` mirrors each session's `context_window`/`rate_limits` to that
dir — the only surface those numbers appear on — and the hook reads them and, at
the caps (context over 65%, 5-hour over 90%, 7-day over 80%), tells the agent to
`/vwf:handoff` then halt. It is bundled with the `statusLine` key (not the
subagent panel) because that main-bar writer is its sensor, and is inert until
the bar runs. **Versions:** `--version`/`-v` prints the CLI version (vs the
latest on npm), the bundled statusline version, and each plugin's installed
version (from `claude plugin list`) vs the latest in the **remote** marketplace
manifest on GitHub (`REMOTE_MARKETPLACE_URL`), flagging updates. **Upgrade:**
`--upgrade` runs **after** any install phase — it `claude plugin update`s every
installed virajp-plugins plugin that's outdated, refreshes the statusline, and
notes a newer CLI; combine with `--all --statusline` for an idempotent
install+upgrade fit for a setup script. `--version`/`--upgrade` need the network
and `claude`, and error out (non-zero) if either is unavailable. **Uninstall:**
`--uninstall` reuses the same selection flags but removes —
`claude plugin uninstall`s the selected plugins (matching their install scope)
and/or strips the statusline keys from `settings.json`, deleting the installed
script once no statusline key remains. Uninstalling the statusline also runs
`uninstallContextCaps` — it strips the caps hook entry and
`AI_PLUGINS_USAGE_DIR` from `settings.json` and deletes
`~/.claude/hooks/context-caps.js` (leaving other hooks/env keys intact). It
leaves the seeded `~/.config/statusline.json` (it may hold user edits) and never
touches external tools (the CLI never installed those).

Before any install, the CLI **checks required external tools** for the resolved
plan: `CORE_DEPS` (just `claude` — the install mechanism) for any plugin
install, plus each selected plugin's `PLUGIN_EXTRA_DEPS` runtime tools
(vwf→rtk+graphify+ mise+pnpm+uv, context7→pnpm, typescript→mise+pnpm, mise→mise,
flutter→mise+kotlin-lsp+ sourcekit-lsp, mempalace→uv, github-actions→mise) and
`node` for the statusline. If any are missing it prints the install command for
each (`DEP_HINTS`) and exits non-zero — it never auto-installs a dependency.
Keep `PLUGINS`, `PROJECT_SCOPED`, `OPT_IN`, `DEP_HINTS`, `CORE_DEPS`, and
`PLUGIN_EXTRA_DEPS` in sync with the marketplace and the plugins' actual runtime
needs (`plugins:check` asserts the `PLUGINS`↔marketplace name sync). Users run
it via `npx @askviraj/ai-plugins …`.

**Two-layer config**, deep-merged low → high (objects merge key-by-key, arrays
replace wholesale; either layer may be absent):

1. `~/.config/statusline.json` (lowest) — per-user; the installer seeds this
   with the full defaults and deep-merges missing settings on re-run. The script
   reads defaults **only** from here, never from a file beside itself.
2. `<repo-root>/.config/statusline.json` — per-repo (highest).

The JSON Schema lives at the **repo root** under
`schemas/statusline.schema.json` (consumed only via its raw GitHub URL,
referenced by `$schema`). User-facing reference docs are at
`docs/statusline.md`. When changing the config shape, keep the script,
`tools/statusline/statusline.json`, `schemas/statusline.schema.json`, and
`docs/statusline.md` in sync.

## CI & Releases

### mise environments

The mise config is split by `MISE_ENV` (all under `.config/`, where mise
resolves env variants):

- `.config/mise.toml` — **generic**, loaded everywhere: the common `node` +
  `pnpm` runtime plus settings/env/`tasks.init`.
- `.config/mise.dev.toml` — loaded when `MISE_ENV=dev` (the maintainer's machine
  has this exported): the full dev toolchain (doppler, pre-commit, dprint,
  taplo, gitleaks, grype, jq, opencode, python, uv) + shell aliases.
- `.config/mise.ci.toml` — loaded when `MISE_ENV=ci` (the workflows set this):
  CI-only tools/settings. Currently sets `node.gpg_verify = false` to work
  around a mise-on-Linux bug where its bundled Node release-key import fails on
  the CI runner's gpg with "no valid OpenPGP data found" (the Node tarball is
  still SHA256-checksum verified). Same mise version verifies fine on macOS; see
  jdx/mise discussion #10553.

Keep common tools in `mise.toml` (don't duplicate across dev/ci); put
environment-specific tools in the matching env file.

### Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

- **`release.yml`** — publishes `@askviraj/ai-plugins` to npm via **OIDC trusted
  publishing** (no stored token, provenance automatic). Triggered three ways: a
  pushed `v*` tag, `workflow_dispatch`, or **`workflow_call`** (invoked by
  `deps-update.yml`). It sets up mise (`MISE_ENV=ci`), checks out the target ref
  (the `ref` input when called, else the triggering ref), verifies the tag
  matches `package.json` (tag pushes only), `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`,
  **osv-scans** the lockfile, **runs the tests** (`mise run i:test`), verifies
  the package (`mise run i:build`), then `npm publish`. The publish step is
  **idempotent** — it skips (does not fail) if that version is already on npm,
  so tag re-points, dispatch retries, and re-runs are safe. **Publishing uses
  the npm CLI; everything else stays pnpm.** The local `i:publish` task mirrors
  the gates + `npm publish`.
- **`deps-update.yml`** — monthly cron (+ manual dispatch): `pnpm update`
  (bounded by the cooldown below); if anything changed, `osv-scanner` gates on
  any known-vulnerable package, then it cuts a **patch release**
  (`mise run i:release --ci` → tests + bump + commit + tag, no push/watch) and
  pushes the refresh + bump + tag to `main`. It then **delegates the npm publish
  to `release.yml` via `workflow_call`** (passing the new tag as `ref`) rather
  than publishing inline: npm allows only **one Trusted Publisher per package**,
  and OIDC's `job_workflow_ref` resolves to `release.yml` even when called — so
  the single `release.yml` Trusted Publisher authorizes this path too. (A tag
  pushed with the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not trigger `release.yml` on
  its own, so it is called directly.)

### Supply-chain settings

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets **`minimumReleaseAge`** (a publish cooldown, in
minutes) so neither installs nor the monthly update adopt brand-new —
potentially compromised — releases.

### One-time manual setup (not automatable here)

- On **npmjs.com**, add this repo + `release.yml` as the **Trusted Publisher**
  for `@askviraj/ai-plugins` (enables OIDC). The workflow-filename field takes a
  **single file** and a package has **exactly one** Trusted Publisher — set it
  to `release.yml` only (not a comma-separated list, and not `deps-update.yml`,
  which publishes *through* `release.yml`). A mismatch surfaces only at publish
  time as `ENEEDAUTH`. Until configured, `release.yml` cannot publish.
- To cut a release: run **`mise run i:release`** (`--minor`/`--major` to choose
  the bump) — it requires a clean tree, runs the tests, bumps the version,
  commits, and creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag, then (interactively) **pushes the
  commit and tag and watches the `release.yml` run to completion**
  (`gh run watch
  --exit-status`), so the task only succeeds if the npm-publish
  pipeline does (needs `gh` installed + authenticated). **Passing `--ci` stops
  after the tag** (no push/watch) — `deps-update.yml` passes it and does its own
  push + `workflow_call` publish. Prefer releasing via CI over local `i:publish`
  so every version keeps the strongest npm trust level (trusted publisher).

## Hooks

`vwf` ships two `PreToolUse` / `Bash` hooks (declared in `hooks/hooks.json`):

- `hooks/npm-to-pnpm.sh` — rewrites `npm`/`npx` commands to `pnpm`.
- `rtk hook claude` — requires the `rtk` CLI on `PATH`, installed out-of-band
  via `brew install --formulae rtk`. Plugin install does **not** provide it;
  document it as a prerequisite.

Things to know when editing hooks here:

- **Plugin hooks are never written to `settings.json`.** They are
  auto-discovered from `hooks/hooks.json` and loaded in-memory at session start.
  Verify active hooks with `/hooks`, not by inspecting `settings.json`.
- **Hook scripts must be portable to macOS BSD `sed`.** BSD `sed` does not
  support `\s` or `\b` — use POSIX classes (`[[:space:]]`) and explicit
  boundaries instead. `npm-to-pnpm.sh` follows this.

## Adding a Plugin

1. Create `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with only the fields the
   plugin needs.
2. Register it in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` under `plugins[]` with a
   `version` (the marketplace `version` is what end-user installs pin to — bump
   it to ship changes).

## Adding a vwf Skill

Create `plugins/vwf/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — no other registration is needed
(auto-discovered). Workflow skills (what used to be commands) stay slash- AND
model-invocable — set `disable-model-invocation: false` like the existing ones;
`true` is reserved for skills that must stay user-only (none in vwf today). For
auto-applying doctrine, set `user-invocable: false` + `paths:` scoping. Skill
names must be unique across **all** local plugins (`plugins:check` enforces this
— OpenCode installs them into one flat namespace).

## Installation (end-user)

```sh
# Add marketplace once (user-scoped)
claude plugin marketplace add --scope user virajp/ai-plugins

# Install a plugin into a project
claude plugin install --scope project <plugin-name>@virajp-plugins
```

Available plugin names: `vwf`, `markdown`, `typescript`, `flutter`, `mempalace`,
`claude-design`, `context7`, `mise`, `github-actions`, `andrej-karpathy-skills`
(external, opt-in). (The statusline is not a plugin — install it via
`npx @askviraj/ai-plugins …`; see The installer & statusline CLI.)

Installing `vwf` pulls in its dependencies (`claude-design`, `context7`,
`markdown`, `mempalace`, `mise`) automatically from the same `virajp-plugins`
marketplace — no other marketplace needs to be registered. See the Dependencies
section above.

For **OpenCode** there is no marketplace: install via the CLI's
`--platform opencode` target, which renders each plugin's skills into
`~/.config/opencode/virajp-plugins/` (url-sourced plugins excluded) — see The
installer & statusline CLI.
