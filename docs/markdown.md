# markdown

An opinionated Markdown and documentation-standards skill for Claude Code. It
auto-applies whenever Claude edits a file matching `**/*.md`, and it is hidden
from the `/` menu (`user-invocable: false`). You never invoke it by hand — it
behaves like an always-on documentation rule that shapes every Markdown change.

## Install

```sh
pnpx @askviraj/ai-plugins --user markdown
```

## What it standardizes

The `documentation-standards` skill carries one ruleset, grouped by concern.

### Writing style

- Short sentences. Present tense. Active voice.
- No filler. Skip "This document describes…" and start writing.
- Code blocks always use a language identifier for syntax highlighting.
- Tables for structured comparisons.

### CHANGELOGs

| Rule           | Standard                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version blocks | One `## vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` heading per version            |
| Unreleased     | None — always commit under a version heading               |
| Entry types    | Match conventional-commit types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor` |

### Keeping docs current

- Update docs when you change a public API, add a module, or change behavior.
- Update the CHANGELOG when bumping a version.
- No documentation stubs — either write the file or don't create it.

### Diagrams

The skill mandates `mermaid` for all diagrams, with portability and clarity
rules:

- Use `mermaid`, never external images. Diagrams must render on both GitHub and
  GitLab — no `%%{init}%%` config directives or custom themes, since portability
  across both is not guaranteed.
- Pick the diagram type by purpose instead of defaulting to a flowchart:

  | Purpose                                  | Diagram type          |
  | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
  | Process, topology, dependencies          | `flowchart` (`graph`) |
  | Interactions over time, API/message flow | `sequenceDiagram`     |
  | Data model, entities and relations       | `erDiagram`           |
  | Lifecycle, status machine                | `stateDiagram-v2`     |

- Quote any label with special characters: `A["pay (USD)"]`, not `A[pay (USD)]`.
  Unquoted parens, brackets, and colons are the top cause of a diagram that
  won't render.
- One concept per diagram. Split rather than cram. Keep node IDs short and
  alphanumeric, and put the prose in the label.
- Use `%%` comments to explain complex parts.
- Exception: things mermaid can't express, such as directory structures, may be
  ASCII inside a fenced block.
